## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">

This is a Arduino library for using the Microchip RNBD451 BLE module with Arduino Zero Board. This has two arduino example projects as shown below.

### Example 1: BLE UART

This BLE UART example Initializes the RNBD451 and starts advertising. The user can scan and connect through MBD App for data transfer via Transparent UART Service.

### Example 2: CENTRAL & PERIPHERAL

This application has two example CENTRAL and PERIPHERAL. The central device scans frequently for the peripheral device and gets connected to it. The user can exchange data between both device via serial port
